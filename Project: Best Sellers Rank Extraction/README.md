This is a project to figure out the HTML and CSS pathway to select the BEST SELLERS RANK.

Selection will lead to extraction and writing on a CSV file

Issues: The code is selecting BEST SELLERS RANK in an inefficient manner. Discombobulated nested for loops, wrong indentations, wrong containments. There are a plethora of aspects this code can improve on, starting from the basics.
